      <p> I am <strong>Victor</strong>, a freelance digital artist from Belarus. I've always loved
      creating art, painting, and drawing ever since my childhood. Films and gaming
      have had a large influence on the pieces that I create, with a focus on
      sci-fi and post-apocalyptic themes.</p>
      
      <p>Despite lacking formal artistic education, I am constantly striving to learn
      from others and improve my skills. I experiment with various styles such as realistic,
      cartoon, anime, and pixel art. Video games have held a special place
      in my heart since my childhood.
      </p>

      <p>However, the year 2015 brought about a profound change in my life.
      It was then that I discovered the amazing world of Virtual Photography.
      As a long-time fan of both the beautiful and the creepiness of in-game worlds,
      I was filled with joy when I realized I could capture these moments through virtual photography.

      <p>If you're interested in commissioning artwork, hiring me as a screenshot artist for your game,
      or simply want to have a chat, please don't hesitate to reach out to me <a href="mailto:pino28kkio@gmail.com">via email</a>.</p>
